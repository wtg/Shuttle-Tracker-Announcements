# Shuttle Tracker Utilities
Currently, this repository contains the Announcement Composer and Mapping Utility apps. You can download pre-built, pre-signed binaries from the `Build` directory.

*Due to how GitHub handles macOS packages in its Web interface, you might need to download or to clone the entire repository to access any pre-built apps in the `Build` directory.*

## Announcement Composer
Announcement Composer is a tool for submitting cryptographically signed announcements to the Shuttle Tracker server. These announcements are then displayed to users by the various frontends.

## Mapping Utility
Mapping Utility makes the process of constructing and refining mapping algorithms easier with a graphical interface for interactive experimentation.
