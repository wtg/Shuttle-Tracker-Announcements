# Shuttle Tracker Utilities
Currently, this repository contains the Announcement Composer, Milestone Composer, and Mapping Utility apps. You can download pre-built, pre-signed binaries from the `Build` directory.

*Due to how GitHub handles macOS packages in its Web interface, you might need to download or to clone the entire repository to access any pre-built apps in the `Build` directory.*
